DISCO:
 - Chatbot uses incredibly complicated methods (hashing passwords?)
 - 
 - 
Q/C/C:
q0: Many tries, multiple sections of code did not run entirely 
q1: Many errors with regard to bash and password mangement, in the spirit of creating something entirely written by AI I stubbornly asked the chatbot to rewrite its own code and recognize the mistake. Needed to ask the chatbot to create a home directory, as the initially created app would not run. 
q2: It's fairly similar! The app is rather css-less and without much spice.
